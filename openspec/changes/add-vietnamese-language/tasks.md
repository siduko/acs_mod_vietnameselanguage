# Tasks for Add Vietnamese Language (Vi)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Preparation and Initial Setup**
    - [ ] Create the `Language/Vi` directory.
    - [ ] Copy all files and subdirectories from `Language/Th` to `Language/Vi`.
    - [ ] Identify configuration files that need updating (e.g., `Language/Config.xml`, `Info.json`).

- [ ] **Phase 2: Configuration Updates**
    - [ ] Modify `Language/Config.xml` to include the new 'Vi' language entry.
    - [ ] Update `Info.json` to reflect the availability of the 'Vi' language.
    - [ ] (If applicable) Update any other project-specific configuration files that enumerate supported languages.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Verification**
    - [ ] Verify that the `Language/Vi` directory structure and content are identical to `Language/Th`.
    - [ ] Run any existing language-related tests (if available).
    - [ ] Manually check the application (if possible) to ensure 'Vi' is selectable and loads correctly (even with placeholder text).

- [ ] **Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation**
    - [ ] Remove any temporary or redundant files created during the process.
    - [ ] Add documentation for the new language support.
