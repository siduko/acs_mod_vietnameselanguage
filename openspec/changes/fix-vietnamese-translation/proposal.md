# Proposal: Fix Vietnamese Translation

## Problem

Some files in the `Language/Vi` directory, which are intended to be in Vietnamese, contain Thai text. This needs to be corrected to ensure the language pack is consistent and accurate.

## Proposed Solution

This proposal outlines a collaborative process to identify and translate the remaining Thai text to Vietnamese within the `Language/Vi` directory.

The process will be as follows:

1.  **Identify Files with Thai Text:** I will scan all text-based files within the `Language/Vi` directory to detect the presence of Thai characters.
2.  **Extract and Present Text:** For each file containing Thai, I will extract the specific strings or text blocks that are in Thai and present them to you.
3.  **Manual Translation:** You will provide the accurate Vietnamese translation for each of the extracted Thai text blocks.
4.  **Apply Translations:** I will then programmatically replace the original Thai text with your provided Vietnamese translations in the respective files.

This approach ensures that the translations are accurate and of high quality, as you, the user, will be providing them. It also automates the tedious process of finding and replacing the text.
