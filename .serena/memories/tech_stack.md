The project primarily utilizes configuration files and text-based language data for localization. Key file formats include:
- `.json`: For basic project information.
- `.xml`: For structured language configurations and data (e.g., `Config.xml`, `UIText.xml`, various files under `Language/Vi/Settings/`).
- `.txt`: For dictionaries and lists of localized strings.
- `.png`: For image assets (e.g., flag icons).

There is no traditional "tech stack" involving programming languages or frameworks. The project focuses on data modification and organization for game localization. The `openspec` tool seems to be used for managing changes and proposals.
